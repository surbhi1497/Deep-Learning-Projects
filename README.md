# Deep-Learning-Projects
I have learned Deep Learning from YouTube, somme Udemy courses, then Deep-Lizard, now I am learning from coursera courses from deeplearning.ai
Here, you can check the course content, https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning, it's an amazing Specialization course.
I have made a project using CNN model, using dataset from Kaggle, www.kaggle.com, here, our trained model can distinguish between a dogg and cat image.

I have made a VGG16 model, using MobileNet Image Classification and Digit classification, taking hand gestures as input.
You can find the whole links of datasets and code in the file. 
Happy Analyzing.
